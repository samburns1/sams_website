<h2>legs as deformable manipulators [ongoing]</h2>
        <p>
           the first phase of the project was finding a suitable enviornemnt to train the robot. this was a time consuming task, as we needed to find an MPC (model predictive control)
          which would allow us to utilize a tripod stance freeing up one of the legs for manipulation. after several months of iterations, we settled on an MPC which runs in pybullet. 
          the MPC was built for a different robot, which tasked us with tuning the MPC to our liking, so we could properly control the go2. the mpc is complex, but using llms,
           i can quickly understand the code t a high level, and make changes without

        <h2>next steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>use supervised learning to train the go2 to move a rope</li>
