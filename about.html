            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by planes, especially heavy commercial airliners. 
          The LA skies are full of them, and if you spend time around me, you’ll notice I spend too much time looking up guessing the plane above and its origin.
            The action button on my phone is bound to flightradar24...
            Right now, the A350 is my favorite.
            </p>
      
        <p>
            I have a deep passion for engineering that extends beyond aerospace, particularly in the realms of robotics and artificial intelligence. 
            I'm lucky to be a part of research in a lab that leverages machine learning to enable robots to perform increasingly natural, human-like tasks.
            The work challenges the traditional boundaries of machine capabilities and redefines what was once considered exclusively the human domain.

            In a world of quickly evolving tech, I've found that AI has become my gateway to expanding beyond my core expertise. 
            The field complements my quick learning ability and ability to absorb new information, create, and innovate. 
            AI technology has opened up exciting new horizons for my engineering journey. I am grateful/thrilled for opportunities to learn.
           </p>


        <p> Also, I enjoy exploring and like stay busy. 
        LA is huge and has been a great stomping ground the last few years. The food here is amazing and the endless variety is unlike anything I have ever experienced. 
        My girlfriend introduced me to sushi, and luckily there is no shortage of good salmon (my favorite).
      </p>

        <p>Sports/exercise are also a major part of my life. I played competitive soccer for 15+ years up until college. Even though I have less time for athletics, 
          I try to routinely exercise, whether that is going to the gym or pickup basketball/soccer. 
        My favorite sport is actually basketball, but unfortunately that is more of a hobby than a talent. Soccer suits my height better.
        LA also has great sports culture and there is never a shortage of local games to put on tv, alongside the 4 major sports stadiums within a 2 miles radius of my apartment.
        Sadly, USC athletics tends to disappoint (football), but we beat ucla this year which was a 10/10 experience.</p>
