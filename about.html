        <h2>hi. i'm sammy, but i also go by sam. or samuel too</h2>
        
        <p>if you somehow missed it, i love planes, and if you are around me enough, you'll notice i'm usually staring up.
        the la aerospace keeps me busy and i can name the plane and its destination with pretty high accuracy. my current favorite plane is the a350.</p>
      
        <p>aside from aerospace, i am super interested in other facets of engineering. i love ai and its use cases/applications excite me. 
          ai has let me  expand out of my areas of expertise, creating an opportunity to rapidly
        absorb new information. i am a quick learner, which pairs well with my passion to learn and create.</p>

        <p>i firmly believe that understanding how to use LLMS as a learning supplement is a critical skillset,
        especially in times where tech is advancing at such a rapid rate. we need to keep up somehow!</p>

        <p>although planes got me started, my experience as an undergrad has made me realize i am still finding my niche.
        from fluids to robotics, there is so much to explore, and i am grateful/thrilled for opportunities to learn.</p>

        <p>i promise though, planes aren't my whole personality *i hope. i love to explore and stay busy. 
        la has been a great stomping ground the last few years and its food really sticks out. 
        my girlfriend got me hooked on sushi, and luckily la has no shortage of good salmon.
        we have been trying all the food around here and rating them on beli (@madlads).</p>

        <p>sports/exercise are also a major part of my life. i played competitive soccer for 15+ years and force myself to go to the gym.
        i play/watch a lot of basketball, but unfortunately i'm very average height otherwise i would have played more.
        la has great sports culture and there is never a shortage of local games to put on tv.
        there is literally 4 major sports stadiums within a 2 miles radius of my apartment.
        sadly usc sports tends to disappoint. we beat ucla this year which was a 10/10 experience. very redeeming.</p>
