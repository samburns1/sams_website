        <h2>hi. im sammy, but i also go by sam. or samuel too</h2>
         
        <p>
         if you somehow missed it, i love planes, and if you are around me enough, you'll notice i'm usually staring up. the la aerospace keeps me busy.
         my current favorite plane is the a350. </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>
         aside from aerospace, i am super interested in other facets of engineering. im an ai optimist, and its use cases and applications excite me. 
         ai allows me to expand out of my areas of expertice, creating an opportunity to rapidly absorb new information.
         i am a quick learner, which pairs well with my passion to learn and create. llms let me do more, and i firmly believe that understanding how to use them as a learning supplement is a critical skillset, 
         especially in times where tech is advancing at such a rapid rate. we need to keep up somehow!
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>
        although planes got me started, my experience as an undergrad has made me realize i am still finding my niche. from fluids to robotics, there is so much to explore, and i am grateful/thrilled for opportunities to learn.
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>
        i promise though, planes aren't my whole personality *i hope. i love to explore and stay busy.  
        la has been a great stomping ground the last few years and its food really sticks out. my girlfriend got me hooked on sushi, and luckily la has no shortage of good salmon. 
        we have been trying all the food around here and rating them on beli (@madlads). 
        sports/exercise are also a major part of my life. i played competetive soccer for 15+ years and force myself to go to the gym. 
        i play/watch a lot of baskegball, but unfortunately im very average height otherwise i would have played more. 
        la has great sports culture and there is never a shortage of local games to put on tv. there is literally 4 major sports stadiums within a 2 miles radius of my apartment. 
        sadly usc sports tends to disappoint. we beat ucla this year which was a 10/10 experience. very redeeming.
